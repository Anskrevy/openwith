**Branches**
Releases are made from the `master` branch, except if a major version has its own branch for bugfixes, such as `v5.5`. Anything yet to be released is on the `unreleased` branch, or a descendant.

**Tags**
Each version I upload to AMO is tagged with a version number. Some things tagged with a version number are not on AMO.
